# DSA
 My daily journey of solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems in Java.

Welcome! This repository is a personal log of my daily practice solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, build consistency, and prepare for coding interviews.

## What to Expect
-  One or more problems added daily
-  Focus on understanding core concepts
-  All solutions written in **Java**

## Week 1 - DSA Basics
-  Day 1: Number programs (Basics)
-  Day 2: More number problems (Reverse, Palindrome, Armstrong, Prime Numbers, Spy Numbers, etc.)
-  Day 3: Number series (Fibonacci, Tribonacci, Arithmetic Progression, Geometric Progression, Catalon Series, etc.)
-  Day 4: Array basics (input/output, smallest/largest, insert/delete, sum, reverse, etc.)
-  Day 5: Array problems (Leaders, Alternates)
-  Day 6: More array problems (Duplicates, Rotate, Pairs, Sub-arrays)
-  Day 7: Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary, Jump)
